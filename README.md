# new_caretool 

There is a lot of junk in here, so just focus on a few files to work from:


"care-tool.html" houses the multi-page template that I was working on


"caretool.js" houses the javascript that accompanies the html


"customstyles.css" has the styles that i've been making on the fly


"json" & "jquery.mobile" folders are obviously necessary


The other html files in the main directory are either crap that I had been toying around with earlier, or ideas on pages that I was going to bring into the 1-file template
